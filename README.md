# CSDP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EQt/CSDP.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EQt/CSDP.jl)

Julia wrapper to [CSDP](https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp) semidefinite programming solver.
On Unix systems, the source code is downloaded and build.
On Windows, the binaries of version 6.1.0 are just downloaded.

## Problems so far...
The build system only provides a static library.
